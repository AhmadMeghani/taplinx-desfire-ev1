MIFARE SDK is growing in functionality, support and becomes TapLinx. This means 
more supported products, more features and an extended OPEN API on Java level. 
It will be a one-stop shop for mobile NFC development, community exchange and 
support as well as for online purchasing of NXP NFC tags. It links NXPâ€™s entire 
NFC smart objects portfolio in one single API, open accessible for every 
developer without license fee.
